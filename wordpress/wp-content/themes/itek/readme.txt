== Notes ==

= WooCommerce =
As of version 1.0.7 WooCommerce related functions and styles will only be activated if and when the plugin is detected as being active.
As of version 1.1.0 only the options for WooCommerce are located in the General Options tab which will in turn be visible only if the plugin is active.

= Social Menu =
Social menu works via the WordPress menu system. To set up your social profile menus please navigate to Appearance >> Menus and create a menu group called social.
Then click on the "Links" link and start adding in your social profiles one by one - ex: url = http://facebook.com/yourprofilename, url text = connect on Facebook.

= Site Logo =
The ideal/recommended logo dimensions are 200-250px width by 30-35px height - logos wider than 250px may cause the menu items to be pushed below the logo depending on the number if items in the menu list.
