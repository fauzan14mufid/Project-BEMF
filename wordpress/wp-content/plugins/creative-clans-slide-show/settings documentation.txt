Slide settings
--------------

- Path
	* Compulsory *
	Contains the absolute path (meaning it has to start with 'http://') to 
	the slides folder, WITH the final slash.

- Load all images from folder
	If 'no', you must specify the images to be used in the 'Images' setting.
	If 'yes', the slideshow will use all images present in the folder
	defined in the 'Path' setting. 
	To use this option, the image folder has to be present on the same site
	as the slide show. No cross domain access is allowed.
	
	Attention: if set to 'yes', the 'Images', 'Captions', 'Links' and 'Link
	           targets' settings will be ignored. This means you won't be 
	           able to set different captions, links and link targets for 
	           each slide.

- Images
	* Compulsory if 'Load all images from folder' is set to 'no' *
	List of the image names, one image per line.
	(if you didn't use the 'path' setting, or only put a part of the path
        there (because you've enabled 'Organize my uploads into month- and 
        year-based folders' in the Wordpress miscellanious settings, or anyway
        the images are stored in different folders), then you'll have to add
        the (missing part of) the path to the image names).

	Attention: this setting is ignored if 'Load all images from folder' is
	           set to 'yes'.

- Captions
	List of the image captions, one caption per line.
	If you don't want to give a caption to one of the images, just leave a 
	blank line.
	If no caption is specified for a slide, the default caption text is used 
	(see Caption settings - Text below).

	Attention: this setting is ignored if 'Load all images from folder' is
	           set to 'yes'.

- Links
	List of the image links, one link per line.
	If you don't want to set a link for one of the images, just leave a blank
	line.
	If no link is specified for a slide, the default link is used 
	(see Several settings - Link below).

	Attention: this setting is ignored if 'Load all images from folder' is
	           set to 'yes'.

- Link targets
	List of the image link targets, one target per line. 
	If you don't want to set a link target for one of the images, just leave a blank
	line.
	If no target is specified for a slide, the default link target is used 
	(see Several settings - Link Target below).
	Possible values:
	- _self   (The current frame in the current window)
	- _blank  (A new window)
	- _parent (The parent of the current frame)
	- _top    (The top-level frame in the current window)

	Attention: this setting is ignored if 'Load all images from folder' is
	           set to 'yes'.

Color codes

All color codes that can be set in the widget, must be set
in the form 

0xXXXXXX

where XXXXXX is the 6 digit hexadecimal color code.
For example, 0x000000 is black, and 0xFFFFFF is white.

On the internet, a search for example for 'hex color codes' 
will give many sites where you can find these codes.
