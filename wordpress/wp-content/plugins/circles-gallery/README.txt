== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I want to use another lightbox instead of the provided one =

The MONO and MULTI licenses bundle 6 different lightboxes. However you can use any other lightbox you want also with the Free license. If you have installed a lightbox plugin then you just need to select "Direct link to image" in the "Lightbox" settings.

= What image size should I use? =

The size of the images is not important because the final image will be resized to the size of the circle. So you should just be sure to choose a size that is at least big as the size of the circle.
